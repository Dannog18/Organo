# Organo - A complete Dev Community, separated by Teams

Organo is a complete and stylized Dev Community in React, separated by teams with different colors. With Organo, it's way much easier to find in a group or your company team, what team your colleague works for, what languages he uses, his experience, etc.  

## Key Features ðŸŽ¯

- Well organized: You can easily find technological information about anyone who has already registered.
- Well-styled: Organo is not only extremely functional. It has also a beautiful and user-friendly interface.
- Fast and Efficient: Your data, your control. Always right on time.
- Open Source: Freedom is beautiful, and so is Organo. Open source and free to use.

### Main Objective ðŸš€

Organo is a facilitator. Its main objective is to streamline quick searches and organize each developer in a company into different teams, based on their main characteristics. 

Example: In a company, a specific demand arises for a junior developer. However, he doesn't have the necessary expertise to solve the problem. So instead of reaching out to the work group - or any dev community he's part of - he chooses to use Organo to filter out the characteristics he wants any other developer to have in order to help him with this problem. And then just contact the developer, and it's solved!!!
